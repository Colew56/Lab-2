This package contains 2 algorithms to solve towers of Hanoi recursively and iteratively. The scrip contains code that reads the starting number of disks from an input file and prints the least number of moves for towers of Hanoi, along whith statistic for the run to an output file. 
For example:
if n = 3 
the output will be: 
Number of disks:3
Number of moves:7
Time elapsed :0.008499948307871819
disk 1 from A -> to C
disk 2 from A -> to B
disk 1 from C -> to B
disk 3 from A -> to C
disk 1 from B -> to A
disk 2 from B -> to C
disk 1 from A -> to C

To run this code, unzip the file, make sure the input and output files are in the same directory, and execute the script in an IDE. The results from IterInputs.txt will be printed to IterOutputs.txt, and RecurInputs.txt will be printed to RecurOutputs.txt.
